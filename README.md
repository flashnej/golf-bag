# README

This is a virtual golf bag app designed to help golfers track how far they hit with each club.  After signing up, the user's clubs are automatically generated.  From there, they are able to log their shots distance and shot quality each time they use a club.  As more data is entered to the database, users will be able to enter in the parameters of their shot while out on the course so the app can recomend which club they should hit with.  In addition to that, the app will generate a graph that illistrates the distances and a margin of error each club typically hits.


This App is deployed @ https://golfbag.herokuapp.com/
